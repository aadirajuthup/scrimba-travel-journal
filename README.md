# Scrimba Travel Journal

This project is a solution to a challenge from the Scrimba React course. It serves as a **Travel Journal** app, where users can store and display information about places theyâ€™ve visited. This project utilizes React to demonstrate the use of **props**, which are passed down from parent components to child components.

## Features

- Display travel entries dynamically with the use of props.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server used for fast builds and hot module replacement.
